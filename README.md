Great Versioning Tool (gvt), a simplified version control system (like Git), allows for basic file versioning operations. Users can initialize the system, add and detach files, commit changes with optional commit messages, and view version history. It operates within a directory structure, maintaining a record of file versions and their associated commit messages.
